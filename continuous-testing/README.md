# Use Cases

Documentation for understanding use cases, i.e. scenarios important to people and the tools that may help.

#### `use-cases/all.md` [(source)](https://github.com/nasa-ammos/slim/blob/main/continuous-testing/use-cases/all.md)

- _Description:_ source file providing a relevant tree of possible use cases for this particular process improvement need mapped against tools that may help. A particular line entry within the file is either a use case category (has children nodes) or a technological solution (has no children nodes).
- _Directions:_ edit this file and submit pull-requests for changes. To render this file visually, compile the source `all.md` file using https://markmap.js.org or preview from https://markmap.js.org/repl

# Reference Architectures

Documentation for specifiying suggested reference architectures for select use case scenarios. 

#### `reference-architectures/ref-archi-XYZ.md` [(source)](https://github.com/nasa-ammos/slim/blob/main/continuous-testing/reference-architectures/ref-archi-XYZ.md)

- _Description:_ source file providing a reference architecture for a given use case scenario
- _Directions:_ edit this file and submit pull-requests for changes.

# Trade Studies

Documentation for understanding trade offs, feature comparisons, and metrics for a given set of reference architectures mapped to use case tool solutions. Choice of comparison points are solicited directly from community members feedback.

#### `trade-studies/trade-study-XYZ.md` [(source)](https://github.com/nasa-ammos/slim/blob/main/continuous-testing/trade-studies/trade-study-XYZ.md)

- _Description:_ source file providing a table of comparison trade offs
- _Directions:_ edit this file and submit pull-requests for changes.

# Starter Kits

Code & configuration for encoding select reference architecture, with select tools chosen from trade studies, through automation. The key idea for starter kits is to work with folks in the SLIM community and create template solutions that can be easily modified and deployed to enact a process improvment change. These solutions should serve to both provide example implementations and references for getting started. 

#### `starter-kits/starter-kit-XYZ/` [(source)](https://github.com/nasa-ammos/slim/blob/main/continuous-testing/starter-kits/starter-kit-XYZ.md)

- _Description:_ directory containing code or configuration representing a starter kit. A README.md file should be present.
- _Directions:_ edit files within this directory and submit pull-requests for changes.
