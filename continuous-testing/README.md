# Continuous Testing Guide

This this guide, we explore best practices for continuous testing - including exploring scenarios such as automated invocation of unit, regression and integration tests.

## Use Cases

In this section, we provide information about potentially useful *use cases* for continuous testing. The key idea is to provide some more nuanced context for the use cases such that technology (tool) solutions can be shared in context. 

[See list of use cases](use-cases/README.md)

## Trade Studies

Here we provide a table of trade offs, feature comparisons, and metrics for a given set of reference architectures mapped to use case tool solutions. Choice of comparison points are solicited directly from community member feedback.

[See list of trade studies](trade-studies/README.md)

## Reference Architectures

In this section, we provide reference architectures that map to select use case scenarios from the above section. The key idea is to provide an architecture / flowchart that simplifies the understanding of how a particular class of tools to satisfy a use case could be put together to help with continuous testing needs. 

[See list of reference architectures](reference-architectures/README.md)

## Starter Kits

In this section, we provide code and configuration for encoding select reference architectures, with select tools chosen from trade studies, through to automation. The key idea for starter kits is to work with folks in the SLIM community to create template solutions that can be easily modified and deployed to enact a process improvement change. These solutions should serve to both provide example implementations and concrete references for getting started.
