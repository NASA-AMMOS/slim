# Contributing Guide

A contribution guide is an important document directed at *new contributors* to your project - to help them in understanding what and how they may contribute. It can be used to outline expected requirements prior to contributions (i.e. acceptance of licensing terms, signing off on any developer agreements required) as well as to ensure the quality of contributions are in-line with expected project norms. If a developer asks how to contribute, please point them to this guide. This guide also itemizes essential ingredients necessary for a successful patch submission.

We provide a sample contribution guide template below, but please keep in mind to:
- Modify and adapt to your project as needed. You may not need all features of the template guide. 
- Replace all instances of `[INSERT ...]` within the template with your project's specific environment.
