## Introduction

**Background**: A well-defined contribution guide is crucial for open-source projects. It helps new contributors understand the expectations and processes for contributing effectively. We walk you through developing a contribution guide for your project via our template, which sets clear standards for contributions and details a recommended process to follow.

**Use Cases**:
- Guiding new contributors on making meaningful contributions.
- Ensuring contributions align with project norms and requirements.
- Facilitating a transparent and efficient contribution process.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Team Discussion**: Collaborate with your team to decide on adopting a contribution guide template. This step is essential to establish project norms and contribution expectations. Our template touches the following topics that you'll want to consider:
   - License overview
   - Code of Conduct
   - Governance Model
   - Developer environment setup
   - Communication channels
   - How-to in interacting with the codebase
   - Pull requests
   - Ways to contribute (e.g. code, docs, media, etc.)
   - etc.


2. **Customize the Template**: Modify the [Contributing Guide Template](pathname:///assets/governance/contributing-guide/CONTRIBUTING.md) to fit your project's specifics.
   - Copy the template and create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file at the root level of your repository.
   - Replace `[INSERT ...]` placeholders with your project's details. These markers are used throughout to designate customization options.
3. **Integrate with Project**:
   - Add a link to `CONTRIBUTING.md` in your project's `README.md` file under the `Contributing` section.
4. **Communicate**:
   - Share the guide with existing contributors and all new contributors as their starting point.
