# Change Request Templates

Pull requests are the currency for how contributions are made to projects. Having a pre-filled out pull request template offers guidance to your potential developers on how to contribute to your project.

## GitHub Pull Request Template (General)

GitHub provides a mechanism to automatically display a template whenever a potential contributor proposes a pull request to your repository. Please see the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository) on GitHub for details. 

Starter Kits:
- [Pull Request Template](github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE)

To leverage this template, make sure to do the following:
1. Talk with your team about leveraging this template, and seek wide agreement before you adopt
2. Create a new folder within your GitHub repository with the following path: `.github/`
3. Copy the Pull Request Template template file above into the following path:
   1. `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
4. Commit the above file to the `main` branch
5. Whenever you propose a new pull request, your new templates should appear in the text box
