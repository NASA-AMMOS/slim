## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Team Discussion**: Discuss the benefits of a pull request template with your team. Gain consensus on adopting this approach for consistency in contributions. Below is an explanation of our recommended [Pull Request Template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE) file's fields. Adjust as necessary.
   - ***Purpose***: To clearly state the intention behind the pull request. This helps reviewers understand the context and significance of your changes.
   - ***Proposed Changes***:
      - `[ADD]` for new features or content the contributor introduced.
      - `[CHANGE]` for modifications to existing features or code.
      - `[REMOVE]` for removals features or code.
      - `[FIX]` for bug fixes the contributor implemented.
   - ***Issues***: To link any related issues your PR addresses. This creates a traceable connection between the issue and the solution provided.
   - ***Testing***: To document how the contributor tested the changes. Including links to test results or noting the operating systems on which the tests were performed. This assures reviewers of the reliability and effectiveness of changes.

2. **Create Template Directory**:
   - In your GitHub repository, create a `.github/` folder to hold community health files.

3. **Add Pull Request Template**:
   - Copy the [Pull Request Template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE) into `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE`.
   - Commit and push this file to the `main` branch of your repository.

4. **Usage**:
   - Once set up, this template will automatically appear in the pull request description box for contributors to fill out.
