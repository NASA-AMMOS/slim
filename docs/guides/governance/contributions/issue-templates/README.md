# Issue Templates

Issue tickets help development teams keep the language of bug, feature, and other types of issues readable and consistent. Templates appear whenever a person submits a new issue, and helps guide that person in providing the key information that gives developers context for a given issue.

## GitHub Issues (Markdown)

GitHub issue markdown templates provide pre-filled structure, in markdown format, for people to enter issue information. Please see the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates) on GitHub templates for more details.

Starter Kits:
- [Bug Report](./github/bug_report)
- [New Feature](./github/new_feature)

To leverage these template, make sure to do the following:
1. Talk with your team about leveraging this template, and seek wide agreement before you adopt
2. Create a new folder within your GitHub repository with the following path: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`
3. Copy the Bug Report and New Feature template files above into the following paths:
   1. `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`
   2. `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new_feature.md`
4. Commit the above two files to the `main` branch
5. Navigate to your issues tab within GitHub, and you should see options to use your new templates appear

## GitHub Issues (Forms)

GitHub issue forms are a method to provide a _form like_ experience when filling out a new issue ticket. Please see the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms) on GitHub forms for more details.

⚠️ NOTE: GitHub issue forms are currently in beta. When using a third-party issue tracking system like ZenHub, the templates will not be usable in that system. 

Starter Kits:
- [Bug Report](./github/bug_report.yml)
- [New Feature](./github/new_feature.yml)
