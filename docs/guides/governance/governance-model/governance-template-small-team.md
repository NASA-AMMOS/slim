# [INSERT PROJECT NAME] Project Governance

This governance model aims to create an open source community that encourages transparency, contributions, and collaboration, but maintains sound technical and quality standards. Our goal is to build a community comprised of members across the [INSERT PROJECT DOMAIN] community and beyond, including from private organizations, universities, government organizations, and international organizations.

The project follows a fairly liberal contribution model where people and/or organizations who do the most work will have the most influence on project direction. Roles determine decision making influence, and a governing Steering Committee is set up to ensure the project's direction is in-line with requirements/goals while supporting flexibility for future growth and membership. Decision making will primarily be made through a "[consensus-seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making)" approach within the Steering Committee.
