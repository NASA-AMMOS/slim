*Example GOVERNANCE.md template rendering*

## Introduction

**Background**: A governance model is essential for government-sponsored open source projects, particularly for medium and large-sized teams. It helps in liberal acceptance of public contributions while retaining decision-making authority with funding sources. This guide provides a template to integrate a generalized governance model into your project, promoting clear operational structure and community engagement.

**Use Cases**:
- Structuring decision-making processes in open source projects.
- Balancing open contribution with authoritative project direction.
- Establishing clear roles and responsibilities within the project team.

## Prerequisites

* Understanding of open source project management.
* Familiarity with Markdown for editing GitHub documentation.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Team Consultation**: Collaborate with your team and stakeholders to discuss adopting the governance model template. You'll want to consider topics like:
   - Decide on how big of a team you currently estimate wanting to be
   - Roles (and how contributors can be promoted between roles)
   - Committees (the groups that guide your project - if any)
2. **Choose the Right Template**:
   - Depending on the size of your team, choose between:
     - [Governance Model Template (Small Teams)](pathname:///assets/governance/governance-model/GOVERNANCE-TEMPLATE-SMALL-TEAMS.md) - ideal for 1-3 active team members.
     - [Governance Model Template (Medium Teams)](pathname:///assets/governance/governance-model/GOVERNANCE-TEMPLATE-MEDIUM-TEAMS.md) - ideal for 3-10 active team members.
     - [Governance Model Template (Large Teams)](pathname:///assets/governance/governance-model/GOVERNANCE-TEMPLATE-LARGE-TEAMS.md) - ideal for 10+ active team members.
3. **Customize the Template**:
   - Place the template in a `GOVERNANCE.md` file within the root folder of your repository.
   - Modify and personalize the template, replacing `[INSERT ...]` text with specifics for your project.
4. **Implement the Governance Model**:
   - Commit the `GOVERNANCE.md` file to the `main` branch.
   - Link to the governance document in your `README.md` file under the `Contributing` section.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: What is the importance of a governance model in open source projects?**
- A: It provides a framework for decision-making, contribution processing, and project management, ensuring transparent and structured project operations.


- **Q: What is the role of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) in this governance model?**
- A: The TSC handles technical decisions, governance processes, and maintains collaborator lists, playing a key role in guiding the project's technical aspects.


- **Q: How are conflicts resolved in this governance model?**
- A: The model advocates for consensus-seeking; however, if consensus cannot be reached, the Product Manager has final authority, ensuring decision-making progresses.


- **Q: Can the governance structure be modified as the project evolves?**
- A: Yes, the model is flexible and can adapt to changing project needs, subject to agreement by the Project Steering Committee (PMC) and stakeholders.
