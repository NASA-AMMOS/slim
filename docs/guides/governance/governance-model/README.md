# Governance Model

This governance model template seeks to generalize how most government-sponsored open source projects can expect to operate in the open source arena. It is targeted towards medium and large-sized teams. This template governance model can be included in your repository under the file name `GOVERNANCE.md`. There are two key philosophies behind this governance model to keep note of:
- Liberal acceptance, encouragement and promotion of open source contributors from the public
- Retention of decision-making authority to sources of funding
