# Continuous Integration Best Practices

<pre align="center">A guide for implementing continuous integration in software projects.</pre>

## Introduction

**Background**: Continuous Integration (CI) is a critical component of modern software development. This guide introduces a comprehensive approach to CI, covering analysis and testing to orchestration and release management. We focus on using a variety of tools like Git hooks, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and more to create a robust CI pipeline. By following this guide and combining these tools, developers can automate their build and testing processes, ensuring that their software is always ready for deployment.

**Use Cases**:
- Automating software build and testing processes.
- Streamlining software release and deployment.
- Ensuring software quality and reliability through regular integration and testing.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Explore CI Tools and Frameworks**:
   - Start with the [Continuous Integration Tools and Frameworks](continuous-integration-frameworks.md) guide to understand a wide array of CI tools.
   - Review different categories like Analysis and Testing, Credentialing, and Execution and Reporting Tests.
   - Based on your use case, select appropriate tools, e.g. Git hooks, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Maven plugins, or SetupTools that fit into various aspects of your CI use case.

2. **Understand the Reference Architecture**:
   - Dive into the [Continuous Integration Reference Architecture](reference-architecture.md) for an overview of the CI process and its components.
   - Understand the core concept of the CI pipeline, which involves systems like Development System, Continuous Integration System, and Continuous Deployment System.
   - Learn about the discrete process steps in a CI pipeline, such as Compile, Test, Package, and Publish, and how they contribute to building and releasing software.

3. **Combine Reference Architecture with Selected Tools**:
   - With the understanding of CI tools from **Step 1** and the architectural insights from **Step 2**, begin mapping tools to specific roles in your CI pipeline.
   - For example:
     - Use Git hooks for code check-ins and GitHub Actions for automated build and testing processes. 
     - Utilize Jenkins or GitHub Actions for more complex workflows, like orchestrating builds across different environments or managing deployment strategies.
     - Implement credentialing tools like Jenkins Credentials Binding Plugin or OAuth for secure access to resources.
     - Ensure testing is thorough by integrating language-specific plugins or frameworks, such as Maven for Java or PyTest for Python, into your build process.
     - Use orchestration tools like Ansible for deployment, aligning them with your cloud infrastructure managed by Terraform or Kubernetes.
     - Package your application using Docker or appropriate tools, ensuring a streamlined process from development to deployment.
  - Update a copy of the reference architectural diagram with your selected tools.
