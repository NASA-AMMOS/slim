#### 4. **Testing Tools Selection:**

- **Automated Unit Testing:**
  - Framework: Pytest for Python
  - Measure Success: 90% of codebase covered by automated unit tests.
  - Frequency: Run on each code commit.

- **Integration Testing:**
  - Framework: Pytest for Python
  - Measure Success: All critical interactions between components validated.
  - Frequency: Run after major code merges.

- **Regression Testing:**
  - Tools: Selenium for UI regression testing
  - Measure Success: No new issues introduced by code changes.
  - Frequency: Run after each code commit.

- **Performance Testing:**
  - Tool: Apache JMeter
  - Measure Success: The system handles expected workloads with response times within acceptable limits.
  - Frequency: Run performance tests every month.

- **Security Testing:**
  - Tools: Dependabot for dependency scanning, SonarQube for code security analysis
  - Measure Success: No critical security vulnerabilities are present in the code.
  - Frequency: Run security scans on each code commit.
