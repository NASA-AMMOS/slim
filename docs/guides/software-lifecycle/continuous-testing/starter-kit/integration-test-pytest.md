## Prerequisites
```
pip install pytest
```


## Integration test example using pytest
```python
# File: test_integration.py

import requests
from your_application import app  # Replace 'your_application' with your actual application module

def test_api_integration():
    # Ensure that your API is up and running
    response = requests.get("http://localhost:5000/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200

    # Add more integration test cases here based on your API endpoints
    # Example:
    # response = requests.get("http://localhost:5000/api/data")
    # assert response.status_code == 200
    # assert "expected_data" in response.json()

def test_database_integration():
    # Ensure that your database connection is working
    # Example:
    # user_data = get_user_from_database(user_id=1)
    # assert user_data is not None

    # Add more database integration test cases here

# You can add more test functions for different components (e.g., external services, messaging queues)

# Example fixture to set up and tear down resources if needed
# See Pytest fixtures for more information: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html

# Fixture for setting up resources
@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def setup_resources():
    # Perform setup operations if needed
    print("Setting up resources for integration tests")
    yield
    # Teardown operations if needed
    print("Tearing down resources after integration tests")

# Use the fixture in your tests
def test_with_fixture(setup_resources):
    # Your test logic here
    pass
```
