# Unit Test starter kit using Pytest
Pytest is a popular Python testing framework that makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases. Here's a basic unit test starter kit using Pytest:

1. **Installation**: First, ensure you have Pytest installed. If it's not installed, you can use pip to install it:

   ```
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. **Project Structure**:

   Create a project directory structure like this:

   ```
   my_project/
   ├── app.py
   └── tests/
       └── test_app.py
   ```

   - `my_project`: The main project directory.
   - `app.py`: Your Python application code that you want to test.
   - `tests`: A directory for your test files.
   - `test_app.py`: Your test cases for the `app.py` code.

3. **Writing a Test Case**:

   In `test_app.py`, you can write your test cases using the Pytest framework. For example:

   ```python
   # test_app.py
   import app  # Import your application code

   def test_addition():
       result = app.add(2, 3)
       assert result == 5

   def test_subtraction():
       result = app.subtract(5, 2)
       assert result == 3
   ```

4. **Running Tests**:

   To run the tests, navigate to your project directory and execute:

   ```
   pytest
   ```

   Pytest will automatically discover and run the test cases in your `test_*.py` files. You should see output indicating whether the tests passed or failed.

5. **Assertions**:

   Pytest simplifies assertions. You can use standard Python `assert` statements as shown in the test cases above. If the assertion fails, Pytest will provide detailed information about the failure.

6. **Coverage**:

   If you want to measure code coverage, you can use a tool like `pytest-cov` with the `--cov` option. Install it with:

   ```
   pip install pytest-cov
   ```

   Run your tests with coverage like this:

   ```
   pytest --cov=app
   ```

   Pytest will generate a coverage report showing which parts of your code are covered by the tests.

With this starter kit, you can start writing and running unit tests for your Python application using Pytest. You can expand it by adding more test cases, fixtures, and custom configurations as needed for your project.
