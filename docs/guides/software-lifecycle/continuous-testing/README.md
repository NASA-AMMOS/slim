# Continuous Testing

<pre align="center">This page provides an overview of continuous testing, offers a ready-to-use continuous testing plan template, and addresses valuable feedback from our community members.</pre>

## Introduction

**Background**: Continuous testing (CT) is a powerful approach that automatically analyzes your software throughout the development process, not just to find bugs, but to ensure it performs well, is secure, and functions flawlessly. CT provides rapid feedback, letting you identify and fix problems early, before they become major issues. This leads to faster releases, improved software quality, and happier users.

**Philosophy**: To provide a simple, consistent, easy-to-use continuous testing plan template and recommend tools to bootstrap your project with the essentials needed for a high-quality continuous testing setup. 

**Use Cases**:
- Ensuring consistent and thorough validation of new code changes
- Identifying and addressing potential performance bottlenecks
- Validating security measures
- Ensuring seamless integration of new features
- Providing timely feedback for developers to streamline the debugging process
- Automating repetitive and time-consuming testing tasks
- Facilitating quicker releases
- Fostering a culture of continuous improvement in software development

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Step 1: Define Your Continuous Testing Goals**
   - Clearly outline the objectives and goals you aim to achieve with continuous testing. Identify key performance indicators and success criteria.

2. **Step 2: Select Continuous Testing (CT) Tools**
   - Choose a CT tool that aligns with your development environment. 

3. **Step 3: Set Up Automated Unit Testing**
   - Implement automated unit testing using suitable frameworks for your programming language (e.g., JUnit for Java, Pytest for Python).

4. **Step 4: Implement Integration Testing**
   - Set up automated integration tests to verify the interactions between different components. Use frameworks like Jest (JavaScript) or Pytest (Python).

5. **Step 5: Establish Regression Testing**
   - Implement regression tests to ensure new code changes do not introduce issues in existing functionalities. Tools like Selenium and Playwright are popular for UI regression testing.

6. **Step 6: Integrate Performance Testing**
   - Use tools like Apache JMeter to perform load and performance testing. Ensure your system can handle various conditions and workloads.

7. **Step 7: Implement Security Testing**
   - Integrate security testing tools such as Dependabot for dependency scanning and SonarQube for code security analysis.

8. **Step 8: Verification and Validation (V&V)**
   - Set up tools like ESLint (JavaScript), PyLint (Python), or other linters for static code analysis. Ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.

9. **Step 9: UI/UX Testing**
    - Implement automated UI/UX testing using tools like Selenium or Playwright to validate the user interface and overall user experience.

10. **Step 10: Reporting and Analysis**
    - Utilize tools like SonarQube for comprehensive code quality and analysis reporting. Leverage reporting to identify areas for improvement.

11. **Step 11: Collaboration with Jira**
    - Integrate with project management tools like Jira to enhance collaboration, track issues, and manage tasks efficiently.

12. **Step 12: Monitor and Adjust**
    - Continuously monitor the performance of your continuous testing process. Make adjustments based on feedback, changing project requirements, and evolving best practices.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)


---

## Terminology
- **User Interface Testing:** The role of usability testing and user interface testing is an important consideration. We're actively exploring how to integrate this into our continuous testing model.

- **Tool Selection:** We understand that implementing all the recommended tools might be challenging due to resource constraints. We're creating a common subset of tools for all projects and prioritizing their importance.

- **Project Maturity:** We recognize that some projects may not be mature enough for certain tools. We recommend waiting until your project reaches an appropriate stage for tools like integration testing.

- **Priority Phases:** We've noted that security, verification and validation, and integration testing are essential phases. We'll prioritize these in our guidelines.

- **Licensing:** Licensing is a crucial factor even in open source tools. We're exploring how to address this concern better.

- **Iterative Implementation:** Iteration is key to successful continuous testing. We understand that it may take time to get it right, and we encourage iterative test implementation.
