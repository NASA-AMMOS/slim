# Security Best Practices for Developers

<pre align="center">Recommended security best practices for developers.</pre>

## Introduction

**Background**: In an era of ever-evolving cyber threats, ensuring the security of applications is paramount. This guide provides developers with recommended security practices rooted in industry standards and best practices for (1) web-applications, (2) application programming interfaces (APIs), (3) continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines (CI/CD). By adhering to these guidelines, developers can bolster the security posture of their applications, prevent potential vulnerabilities, and safeguard their users. Implementing these measures will lead to a safer application landscape and instill greater confidence for users.

**Use Cases**:
- Securing API endpoints against the latest threats
- Enhancing web application security measures
- Implementing security checks within CI/CD pipelines
- Verifying the security controls of web applications

## Step-by-Step Guide

For developers of APIs, Web Applications, and CI/CD pipelines, we recommend ensuring you review the following resources prior to releasing your code. 

1. **Review [OWASP Top 10 API Security Risks - 2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10/)**: Understand and mitigate the top API security risks for the current year.

2. **Review the [OWASP Top 10 Web Application Risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)**: Familiarize yourself with the most critical security risks to web applications and ensure that your applications are safeguarded against them.

3. **Review [OWASP Top 10 CI/CD Security Measures](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-ci-cd-security-risks/)**: Refer to the document dedicated to CI/CD security risks to understand the prevalent threats and ensure that your CI/CD processes are secure.

4. **Utilize the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)**: Adopt the ASVS Project guidelines to test the technical security controls of your web applications and develop applications with a security-first approach.
