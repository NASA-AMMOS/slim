> _A shared resource for discussing, iterating and referencing best practices in software lifecycle process improvements for multi-mission space and ground software_

[üìñ View our Infographic (PDF)](SLIM-Infographic.pdf)

Software Lifecycle Improvement & Modernization (SLIM) is a project focused on collecting, developing, and disseminating best practices and process improvement strategies in NASA multi-mission software development lifecycle ecosystems. SLIM represents both a community of contributors as well as a continually evolving repository for best practices documentation.

## Our Focus

There are three key areas within the software development lifecycle improvement space that SLIM focuses on providing best practice guidance for:

## Our Process

### Community Outreach 

We reach out to community member projects, and solicit input on outstanding process improvement needs, including the respective needs' relative ranking in importance / criticality. A few needs are chosen to focus active contributor time upon - seeking to develop best practice guides, including items such as use case lists, trade-studies, reference architectures and starter kits.

### Standards-as-Code

We use a technique we like to call "standards-as-code", which basically means that we develop best practices that are _patchable_ to existing or new community member project codebases or are _deployable_ to their infrastructure. Therefore, we target providing best practices in a way that is most easily can be infused into existing projects. This way, we are actually able to scale out our best practice dissemination widely to many projects at once.

More information on our development process for best practice guides can be found in our [Contributing Guide](docs/contribute/contributing/development-process).

## Our Community Members

What does it mean to be a community member of SLIM? The following ideas apply to member projects:
- Has a representative (a point-of-contact) who interfaces with the SLIM effort
- Active and timely feedback on SLIM issue ticket prioritization
- Openness and willingness to infuse SLIM best practices 

The following list of projects are currently SLIM member projects:

<ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/nasa-ammos/" rel="NASA AMMOS">

## How To Get Involved

SLIM best practice guides and recommendations are open source, which means you have the freedom to use our work (in accordance with our [LICENSE](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/slim/LICENSE)) as well as contribute and help shape our future work. We're excited to welcome new contributors and users.

Some ways you can get involved with SLIM:

### Use Our Guides

The fastest way to start using SLIM process improvement solutions is to take a look at our best practice guides, specifically our *starter kits*. Starter kits provide plug-and-play solutions to process improvement needs. To complement our starter kits, take a look at *use cases* to understand the context of the starter kit solutions, *trade studies* to understand tool / solution trade-offs, and *reference architectures* to understand how tool / solutions interact in an actual working environment. 

We recommend creating pull-requests using our starter kits against your own repositories. Reach out to our [contributor communication channels](docs/contribute/contributing/know-before-contribute.md#communication-channels) for questions if you're unsure how to create pull requests. An excellent tool to automate the infusion of starter kits in your repositories (especially if you have many) is to use a tool like [multi-gitter](https://github.com/lindell/multi-gitter) if you're using Git to create pull-requests. 

Finally, if you use any of our guides - please consider adding the following badge to your `README.md`:

### Contribute to Our Guides

We're excited to see your contribution! Please see our [Contributing Guide](docs/contribute/contributing) on details for how to contribute. We accept many non-code contributions as well, so feel free to think creatively. 

### Spread the Word

The more people & projects using, contributing, and maintaining SLIM, the more robust and long-term this effort will last.
