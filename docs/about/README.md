# About GenAI Marketplace

> _Enabling GenAI development at JPL through AI-powered best practices and automation._

## What is GenAI Marketplace?

**GenAI Marketplace** is a Jet Propulsion Laboratory initiative that transforms how teams adopt GenAI development best practices. Instead of lengthy documentation, GenAI Marketplace delivers best practices as **automated solutions** that install and configure themselves in seconds.

**What makes GenAI Marketplace unique:**
- 🤖 **AI-powered automation** - Best practices that apply themselves
- 🎯 **One-command installation** - Works with multiple AI tools
- 🔄 **Always up-to-date** - Marketplace evolves with industry standards
- 🏛️ **Internal JPL resource** - Tailored for JPL GenAI development needs
