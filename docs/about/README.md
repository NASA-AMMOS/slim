# About SLIM

> _Modernizing software through the automated infusion of best practices._

## What is SLIM?

**Software Lifecycle Improvement & Modernization (SLIM)** is a NASA initiative that transforms how teams adopt software best practices. Instead of lengthy documentation, SLIM delivers best practices as **automated solutions** that install and configure themselves in seconds.

**What makes SLIM unique:**
- 🤖 **AI-powered automation** - Best practices that apply themselves
- 🎯 **One-command installation** - Works with multiple AI tools
- 🔄 **Always up-to-date** - Marketplace evolves with industry standards
- 🌐 **Open source** - Free to use and contribute ([License](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/slim/LICENSE))

## What We Provide

### Best Practices Hub

Browse and install automated solutions from our [marketplace](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/slim/):

**🎯 Skills**
AI-powered workflows for specialized tasks (README generation, license setup, security scanning, etc.)

**🔌 MCP Servers**
Integrations with external services (GitHub, Slack, APIs)

**🤖 Agents**
Autonomous multi-step operations (security audits, documentation maintenance, compliance checks)

**📝 Manual Guides**
Step-by-step instructions for practices requiring human judgment

### Coverage Areas

Our marketplace includes best practices across numerous categories related to the software development life cycle, including how projects are run, how teams communicate, how information is documented, how operations are conducted, and more.

## How It Works

### For Users

1. **Browse** the [marketplace](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/slim/)
2. **Install** via AI tool (e.g., for Claude Code: `/plugin install skill-name@slim-marketplace`)
3. **Use** by asking your AI assistant

**Compatible AI Tools:**
- Claude Code
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Aider
- Other AI assistants with skill/MCP support

### For Contributors

SLIM is community-driven. [Contribute](/slim/docs/contribute/submit-best-practice) by:
- Creating new skills or agents
- Improving existing best practices
- Sharing your expertise
- Providing feedback on priorities

---

## Our Process

### 1. Community Input
We gather improvement needs from NASA multi-mission projects and prioritize based on impact.

**→ View [planning board](https://github.com/orgs/NASA-AMMOS/projects/3)**

### 2. Develop Automation
Contributors package best practices as skills, MCP servers, or agents with a focus on **automation-first**.

**→ See [contributing guide](/slim/docs/contribute/contributing)**

### 3. Distribute & Track
Solutions are available via the marketplace. Track adoption through our leaderboards:
- [NASA AMMOS Leaderboard](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/slim-leaderboard/blob/main/examples/slim-ammos-leaderboard.md)
- [Unity SDS Leaderboard](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/slim-leaderboard/blob/main/examples/slim-unity-leaderboard.md)
