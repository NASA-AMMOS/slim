# Join

SLIM best practice guides and recommendations are community generated, which means you can join our community! 

Some ways you can get involved with SLIM:

## Use Our Guides

The fastest way to join the SLIM community is to start using our best practice guides in your project(s). 

As you use our best practices, we always recommend working with your project by creating pull-requests. An excellent tool to automate the infusion of our best practices in your repositories (especially if you have many) is to use a tool like [multi-gitter](https://github.com/lindell/multi-gitter) if you're using Git to create pull-requests. 

Some Pro ‚≠êÔ∏è tips:
- Add the following badge to your `README.md` so that your other team members can help:

- üëÄ Watch our repo so you get updates on activities right away. In particular, ensure your notifications are set up to monitor our [Releases page](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/slim/releases) for key updates. 

## Join Our Community of Projects

What does it mean to join the SLIM community as a member project? It means the SLIM project will reach out *to you* about new updates and best practices and offer automated pull-requests for select best practices to be sent to your project's repositories (at no cost!). We welcome new project members who are keen on improving software lifecycle processes within their projects. 

For instance:
- See our current community members in our About page [here](/docs/about/#our-community-members).
- See an example of automated pull requests in-action for our community member repos [here](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/slim-leaderboard/blob/main/examples/slim-ammos-leaderboard.md).

Here's how you can tell us you're interested in joining:

1. **Publicly: Start a Discussion**: Head over to our [discussion forum](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/slim/discussions/new/choose) and file a new thread expressing your interest in joining SLIM. This is a great way to introduce your project and outline how you think SLIM could benefit you.

2. **Privately: Contact Us**: You can directly contact [@riverma](https://github.com/riverma) or the [@slim-steering](https://github.com/orgs/NASA-AMMOS/teams/slim-steering) group on GitHub to express your desire to join. We'll have a chat, and try to identify which repositories in your project make sense for best practice infusion as well as identify a point-of-contact.

## Contribute to Our Guides

We'd be delighted to see your contribution! Please see our [Contributing Guide](/docs/contribute/contributing) on details for how to contribute. We accept many non-code contributions as well, so feel free to think creatively. 

## Spread the Word

The more people & projects using, contributing, and maintaining SLIM, the more robust and long-term this effort will last.
