# GitHub MCP Server Configuration Example for Claude Code

## Prerequisites
# 1. Install the GitHub MCP Server globally:
#    npm install -g @github/github-mcp-server
#
# 2. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token:
#    - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
#    - Generate token with repo, issues, pull_requests permissions
#    - Save token securely

## Environment Setup
# Set your GitHub token as an environment variable:
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_github_personal_access_token_here"

# For GitHub Enterprise users, set custom API URL:
# export GITHUB_API_URL="https://your-github-enterprise.com/api/v3"

## Claude Code MCP Server Configuration

# After installing the MCP server globally, it should be available as:
# Command: github-mcp-server
#
# The exact configuration method for Claude Code MCP servers may vary.
# Check Claude Code documentation for the latest MCP server setup instructions.

## Example Usage After Setup

# Once configured, you can ask Claude Code to:
# - "List the open issues in my repository"
# - "Show me the latest pull requests"
# - "What files were changed in the last commit?"
# - "Create a new issue for this bug"
# - "Browse the repository structure"

## Troubleshooting

# If you encounter authentication issues:
# 1. Verify your GitHub token has the required permissions
# 2. Check that the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is set correctly
# 3. Ensure the token hasn't expired

# For rate limiting issues:
# - GitHub API has rate limits (5000 requests/hour for authenticated users)
# - The MCP server should handle rate limiting automatically

## Security Notes

# - Store your GitHub token securely
# - Don't commit tokens to version control
# - Use tokens with minimal required permissions
# - Rotate tokens regularly for security

## Additional Configuration Options

# The GitHub MCP server may support additional configuration options.
# Refer to the official documentation for the complete configuration reference:
