# Documentation Best Practice Guide

This this guide, we explore best practices for documentation - including for user guides, administrative guides, API documentation, discussions, and other documentation artifacts. 

## Use Cases

In this section, we provide information about potentially useful *use cases* for documentation. The key idea is to provide some more nuanced context for the use cases such that technology (tool) solutions can be shared in context. 

See our [diagram](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/slim/documentation/use-cases/markmap.html) for detailed mappings of documentation use cases

* This diagram provides a relevant tree of possible use cases mapped against tools that we think may help. Read this diagram left-to-right as an English language statement. The parent nodes represent components of a use case, and the leaf nodes (far right) represent tool solutions we think are appropirate for the use case. 
* Feel free to propose additional use cases or feedback for our mind map by submitting a pull request or issue to [the source file](https://github.com/nasa-ammos/slim/blob/main/documentation/use-cases/markmap.md). This file is used to render the above mind-map document visually, using https://markmap.js.org

## Reference Architectures

In this section, we provide reference architectures that map to select use case scenarios from the above section. The key idea is to provide an architecture / flowchart that simplifies the understanding of how a particular class of tools to satisfy a use case could be put together to help with documentation needs. 

*Further resources to be provided soon*

# Trade Studies

Here we provide a table of trade offs, feature comparisons, and metrics for a given set of reference architectures mapped to use case tool solutions. Choice of comparison points are solicited directly from community members feedback.

# Starter Kits

In this section, we provide code & configuration for encoding select reference architectures, with select tools chosen from trade studies, through automation. The key idea for starter kits is to work with folks in the SLIM community and create template solutions that can be easily modified and deployed to enact a process improvment change. These solutions should serve to both provide example implementations and references for getting started.
