# Use Cases

For all use cases below:
* **Visualization** provides a relevant visual tree of possible use cases mapped against tools that we think may help. Read this diagram left-to-right as an English language statement. The parent nodes represent components of a use case, and the leaf nodes (far right) represent tool solutions we think are appropirate for the use case. This file is rendered using https://markmap.js.org
* **Markdown** provides the source Markdown in a textual format. Note: feel free to propose additional use cases or feedback for our mind map by submitting a pull request for this file on our GitHub.
