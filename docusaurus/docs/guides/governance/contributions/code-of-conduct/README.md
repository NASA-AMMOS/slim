# Code of Conduct

The code of conduct is typically a document that provides guidance to a project team on *how* the team members should interact with each other. It identifies behaviors that are helpful for building a better development community, provides contact information for addressing grievances (should they arise), and finally lists key responses that team leadership should / will take for dealing with unexpected behavior. Below are some examples to expedite the incorporation of a code of conduct.

## Directions 

We recommend a community-developed code of conduct called the Contributor Covenant, that has been [adopted by many open source projects](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/adopters/). It provides a fairly standard code of conduct that (1) explicitly identifies problematic behavior that's deemed unacceptable in team interactions, (2) who to contact if problematic behavior is identified, and (3) tiers of how team leadership can respond. 

Starter Kit:
- [Markdown](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/code_of_conduct.md) of template
- [Demo](https://github.com/riverma/terraformly/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) of template and [demo](https://github.com/riverma/terraformly) of badge
- [Webpage](https://www.contributor-covenant.org) for more information

To leverage this template, make sure to do the following:
1. Talk with your team about leveraging this template, and seek wide agreement before you adopt
2. Copy the template text, and place in a file within your repository called `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` 
3. Search and replace the `[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]` text within the file with a person, private e-mail list, or other form of contact for grievances to be addressed to
4. Add the contributor covenant badge (![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)) to your `README.md` file (example below)
