# This is a CODEOWNERS file for GitHub repositories
# It automatically assigns reviewers for pull requests based on file paths
# Documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# Syntax:
# file-pattern    @user-or-team-name

# ===== EXAMPLES (All commented out! Make sure to uncomment the patterns you want to use) =====

# Default owners for everything in the repo (unless a later match takes precedence)
# A request for review needs to be sent to a team for changes to any file
# *    @johndoe @janedoe
# *    @apps-team

# Owners for all files in the root directory
# /*    @root-directory-owners

# Owners for specific file types across the entire repository
# *.js    @javascript-owners
# *.go    @go-owners
# *.sql   @database-team

# Owners for specific directories and all contained files
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# You can use team names as well (must be in the same org)
# /apps/ @johndoe @apps-team
# /api/ @janedoe @api-team
# /docs/ @documentation-team
# /config/ @platform-team
# /scripts/ @devops-team

# Owners for specific files
# /CONTRIBUTING.md        @community-manager
# /LICENSE                @legal-team
# /SECURITY.md            @security-team

# Path exclusions with ! - the following will not match
# /logs/                  @logger-team
# !/logs/high-priority/   @emergency-team

# Nested team ownership
# /src/                   @dev-team
# /src/api/               @api-team
# /src/ui/                @frontend-team

# Different owners based on file location
# package.json            @dependency-managers
# /test/package.json      @test-dependency-managers

# Wildcard patterns
# /src/**/test/           @test-owners
# /src/*/index.js         @index-owners

# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - Order matters! The last matching pattern takes precedence.
# - CODEOWNERS only works on branch protections that require PR reviews.
# - @username, @org/team-name or email@domain.com formats are supported.
# - CODEOWNERS must be in the root, .github/, or docs/ directory to work.
