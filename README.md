# SLIM

> _A shared resource for discussing, iterating and referencing best practices in software lifecycle process improvements for multi-mission space and ground software_

Software Lifecycle Improvement & Modernization (SLIM) is a repository for best practices in the software development lifecycle. It represents both a community of contributors as well as a storage location for best practices documentation.

## Scope

There are three key areas within the software development lifecycle improvement space SLIM focuses on providing resources for:
- Governance
- Information Sharing
- Software Lifecycle Pipelines

More details TBD.

## Process

Every fiscal quarter, SLIM convenes community members to provide input on outstanding process improvement needs, including their relative ranking in importance / criticality. A few are chosen to focus active contributor time upon to generate best practice solutions

More information on currently active needs being solicited from community members is available here: TBD
