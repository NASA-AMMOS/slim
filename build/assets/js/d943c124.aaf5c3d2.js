It's a little bit of an art at this point, but you'll want to keep the level of abstraction high enough that specific solution / tools can be swapped in or out but your diagram will still remain valid.

Think of starter kits as some form of automation that can be quickly and easily infused into SLIM community member projects, with minor adjustments.
