contributing! We very much appreciate your time and effort. This document outlines the many ways you can contribute to our project, and provides detailed guidance on best practices. We look forward to your help!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2><p>SLIM is a joint, community-based effort at collective software process improvements. Therefore, we need your help! Here&#x27;s the basics on contributing:</p><ul><li>Anyone can contribute!</li><li>You can contribute at any time</li><li>You can contribute in any way (code, documentation, discussion topics, issue ticket discussions, etc.)</li></ul><p>We plan out our work into fiscal quarters (i.e. Oct - Dec as Q1, Jan - Mar as Q2, etc.). This helps our stakeholders (the folks using our process improvements) plan to incorporate process improvements better into their schedules. See our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/NASA-AMMOS/projects/3/views/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planning Board</a> for our most up-to-date plan. Generally speaking, we try to get together with our stakeholders and our community contributors at the start of every fiscal quarter to plan out what we should work on. That being said, since we&#x27;re an open source project, we also accept and encourage ad-hoc contributions at any time - just note it may take some time to review / decide whether to incorporate. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="quickstart-to-contributing">Quickstart to Contributing<a href="#quickstart-to-contributing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Quickstart to Contributing" title="Direct link to Quickstart to Contributing">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contributing-via-our-planning-cycles">Contributing via our Planning Cycles<a href="#contributing-via-our-planning-cycles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Contributing via our Planning Cycles" title="Direct link to Contributing via our Planning Cycles">​</a></h4><ol><li>See our open list of <a href="https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/slim/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue tickets</a> and pick a ticket(s) you&#x27;re interested in, that can also potentially apply to a project you&#x27;d like to infuse improvements into. Note: it is useful to scan through labels like how requested (popular) a particular issue ticket is (via labels: &#x27;requested&#x27;, &#x27;more requested&#x27;, &#x27;most requested&#x27;) as well as by scanning labels that describe how complex the ticket is (i.e. &#x27;low complexity&#x27;, &#x27;medium complexity&#x27;, &#x27;high complexity&#x27;).</li><li>Pick a fiscal quarter you’d like to resolve your tickets in. See our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/NASA-AMMOS/projects/3/views/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planning Board</a> &quot;iteration&quot; column for possible fiscal quarters. At the start of every fiscal quarter, contributors will be asked to pick what they&#x27;d like to work on.</li><li>Be a leader to help infuse those process improvement solutions (tickets resolved) back to your existing projects. What does that entail? It means you take ownership of your issue tickets and the associated process improvement and help your project infuse what you worked on! You can also help other projects that are interested in your process improvement. Tip: tag your project team members on the ticket by via their GitHub handles, to make it clear who will be interested in using your process improvement. </li></ol><p>NOTE: taking ownership (being assigned a ticket) requires that they be a member of the SLIM project.

We want to help make sure your best practice solution is not only incorporated into SLIM, but actively used! </p><p>⚠️ NOTE: we recommend engaging with the SLIM community throughout the process, but if you&#x27;ve already created some best practice solutions you just want to document, then you can skip some of the community soliciting steps below and get feedback directly as you&#x27;re developing your documentation. </p><p>The following flowchart provides guidance on the best recommended process for developing and sharing a best practice solution.</p><h6 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="recommended-process-for-contributing-a-best-practice-solution-to-slim">Recommended Process for Contributing a Best Practice Solution to SLIM<a href="#recommended-process-for-contributing-a-best-practice-solution-to-slim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Recommended Process for Contributing a Best Practice Solution to SLIM" title="Direct link to Recommended Process for Contributing a Best Practice Solution to SLIM">​</a></h6><h6 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="understanding-the-recommended-process">Understanding the Recommended Process<a href="#understanding-the-recommended-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Understanding the Recommended Process" title="Direct link to Understanding the Recommended Process">​</a></h6><p>To help you understand the recommended process diagrammed above, this section explains each component of the diagram:</p><p><strong>Use Cases</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Research Use Cases</strong> - search the internet, read books, articles, and talk to folks to understand <em>which</em> scenarios and use cases may apply to the process improvement need. For example, if the need is something like <em>&quot;Living documentation best practices for development lifecycle artifacts&quot;</em> then some use cases could involve things like <code>Automated PyDoc documentation generation from code</code>, <code>User guide generation from static GitHub flavored Markdown</code>. Basically, consult the community and literature to get specific on the pressing use case scenarios for this need, and identify tools that may help support or satisfy this need.</li><li><strong>Create Use Cases Diagram</strong> - here you&#x27;ll want to <em>diagram</em> the research you&#x27;ve collected on scenario / use cases and tools in a format that SLIM community members can easily understand and comment on. The diagramming approach we&#x27;re recommending with use cases is to create a <em>mind-map</em>. See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia article</a> on mind mapping for more information about the technique. To generate consistent mind map diagrams, we&#x27;re suggesting you use a tool called <a href="https://github.com/gera2ld/markmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MarkMap</a> both because it creates interactive mind-maps and because it support diagrams being version controlled and easily edited by multiple people. What you&#x27;ll want to do is to edit the <code>/use-cases/markmap.md</code> document in your local directory with use case and tool information you&#x27;ve researched. Add parent nodes for use cases and leaf nodes for tools within the markdown file. The use cases should come first, and be broken down into categories that logically model the tree of use cases you&#x27;ve collected. You can be as limited or as comprehensive as you like with the use cases, the key is to make sure the use cases are readable. A suggestion is to prefix the parent / child node relationships in this file with English-language prepositions (e.g. In, From, To) for the use case information and the keyword &quot;Using&quot; for the tool information. For example, a parent-child relationship within your markdown file to help share best practices for documentation hosting could be:<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">* Documentation Best Practices</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    * For Hosting</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">        * Of Source-Controlled (Static) Content</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">            * With Markdown support</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                *   Using Jekyll / GitHub Pages</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>Once you&#x27;ve documented your use cases and tools within the respective <code>markmap.md</code> file, you&#x27;ll just need to add and commit your file to GitHub, where an automated GitHub Action (markmap) will auto-generate an equivalent <code>markmap.html</code> rendering of your markdown file and commit it to the same directory where you&#x27;ve stored the <code>markmap.md</code> file (inside the <code>use-cases</code> directory). </li><li><strong>Create Pull Request</strong> - in this step, you&#x27;ll want to <a href="#submit-a-pull-request">create a pull-request</a> for the SLIM community to get feedback on:<ul><li>The coverage of use cases in your diagram (e.g. are you missing critical use cases?)</li><li>An assessment of <em>which</em> use case(s) are highest priority to the community. You&#x27;ll use this to help provide some focus on the scope of reference architectures you should document for your use cases</li><li>Any other suggestions / fixes
Also consider reaching out to the community via our <a href="#communication-channels">communication channels</a> for feedback and engagement for your pull request. Providing an visual example of your modifications is highly encouraged. After your pull request has been evaluated, and you&#x27;ve incorporated change requests / feedback from the community, a maintainer for the project will decide and work towards merging your changes into SLIM for everyone to benefit from.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Trade Studies</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Choose a Use Case</strong> - in this step, you&#x27;ll want first pick a &quot;branch&quot; in your markmap rendering, or non-leaf-node item within your use cases markdown file, that has a list of solutions / tools underneath it that offer SLIM community members some decisions to make based on a trade-study you&#x27;ll create. </li><li><strong>Perform Trade Study</strong> - for the &quot;branch&quot; use case you picked in step 1, you&#x27;ll now want to do some research on important metric criteria by which to evaluate possible tools / solutions. Consider things like important feature differences, performance, monetary cost, maturity, etc., when choosing criteria to evaluate the solution / tools for your use case upon. In terms of actually documenting your trade-studies, we recommend using markdown tables, this way the documentation you write can be easily viewed, version controlled, and modified by multiple people. Add your diagrams to the <code>trade-studies/</code> folder within your best practices parent folder. See the existing examples available in best practice guides for guidance.</li><li><strong>Create Pull Request</strong> - in this step, you&#x27;ll want to <a href="#submit-a-pull-request">create a pull-request</a> for the SLIM community to get feedback on:<ul><li>The scope of metrics you&#x27;ve chosen to perform your trade study upon</li><li>The understandability of your metric values, for the given solution / tools you&#x27;re evaluating</li><li>Any other suggestions / fixes

It&#x27;s a little bit of an art at this point, but you&#x27;ll want to keep the level of abstraction high enough that specific solution / tools can be swapped in or out but your diagram will still remain valid. The key idea here is to provide a reference architecture that&#x27;s largely tool-agnostic, and can be used by SLIM community members easily to understand how a best practice solution data or process flow may look like. The recommended diagramming language here is the <a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mermaid</a> markdown diagramming tool that has native Markdown integrations. This way, diagrams can be easily understood, version controlled, and edited by multiple people. We recommend you follow <a href="https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this tutorial</a> to get started with this framework, use the flowchart diagram feature, and document your flow chart architecture diagram in <code>/reference-architectures/ref-archi-XYZ.md</code>. We also recommend you edit your mind-map markdown files to link to your reference architecture diagrams using hyperlinks. See Markmap <a href="https://markmap.js.org/repl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">examples</a> for hyperlinking.</li><li><strong>Pull Request</strong> - in this step, you&#x27;ll want to <a href="#submit-a-pull-request">create a pull-request</a> for the SLIM community to get feedback on:<ul><li>The scope of steps within your architecture diagram</li><li>The level-of-abstraction of your diagram, and whether its appropriate to generalize the tools you have outlined</li><li>Any other suggestions / fixes

A starter kit can be anything that helps SLIM community members automate some aspect of the use use case you&#x27;ve picked. For example, for our &quot;Documentation Hosting&quot; best practice guide, we offer Markdown templates for various types of documentation categories - thus starter kits don&#x27;t just need to be code or configuration. Think of starter kits as some form of automation that can be quickly and easily infused into SLIM community member projects, with minor adjustments. Additionally, it&#x27;s always a good idea to make your starter kit as generic as possible, including using environment variables to allow SLIM community members to customize the starter kit easily. Add your starter kit scripts or configuration to the <code>starter-kits/</code> folder within your best practices parent folder and see examples in other best practice guides for guidance.</li><li><strong>Pull Request</strong> - in this step, you&#x27;ll want to <a href="#submit-a-pull-request">create a pull-request</a> for the SLIM community to get feedback on:<ul><li>The ease-of-use of your starter kit</li><li>The usefulness of your starter kit</li><li>Any other suggestions / fixes
Also consider reaching out to the community via our <a href="#communication-channels">communication channels</a> for feedback and engagement for your pull request.

The key point of creating starter kits is to infuse them in SLIM community member projects in a consistent way. Since you&#x27;ve worked so hard to make a starter kit, now is the time to propose the starter kit to as many SLIM community member projects as possible! We recommend two methods of infusion:<ul><li>Taking the initiative and creating pull requests or text-file patches using your starter kits for SLIM community member projects. Many SLIM community member projects are busy and may not have the time to propose your starter kits on their own, so leverage the best practice of open development and propose a starter kit to some aspect of their codebase.</li><li>Reach out to SLIM community member projects and socialize your new starter kit to gain interest. Leverage our <a href="#communication-channels">communication channels</a> for this purpose.</li></ul></li></ol><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-adding-improvements-to-an-existing-best-practice-guide">For Adding Improvements to an Existing Best Practice Guide<a href="#for-adding-improvements-to-an-existing-best-practice-guide" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to For Adding Improvements to an Existing Best Practice Guide" title="Direct link to For Adding Improvements to an Existing Best Practice Guide">​</a></h5><p>The Adding a New Best Practice Guide section explains in detail <em>how</em> to add a new best practice guide.
