## Code of Conduct for Collaboration

### Overview
This document outlines the expectations for collaboration, contribution, and interaction with this project. It is designed to balance the needs of the open-source community with the realities of scientific research, including publishing, funding, and achieving scientific impact. 

---

### **Our Metrics of Success**
As a project developed by scientific researchers, our primary metrics of success are:
1. **Achieving scientific and societal impact.**
2. **Publishing articles in peer-reviewed journals.**
3. **Gathering funding to support ongoing research and development.**

We strive to balance the demands of open-source development with these goals. Sustainable collaboration is key to achieving these aims.

### **Open Science Commitment**
This project is committed to open science, transparency, and community-driven development, in alignment with initiatives like **NASA's TOPS** (Transform to Open Science). However, open-source development requires significant time and effort, and we want to ensure all collaborators understand the expectations involved.

#### What We Offer:
1. **Access to cutting-edge research and software** for community use.
2. **Openness in sharing methods and ideas** while still competing in scientific research.
3. **Opportunities for collaboration** that align with our metrics of success.

#### What We Expect from You:
1. **Respect for Our Time and Resources**  
   Open-source software does not mean free support. We ask that you respect the fact that developing and maintaining software, alongside research, is a time-intensive process. Please make your queries clear and concise to help us assist you efficiently.

2. **Collaborate, Don’t Compete**  
   Open science thrives on collaboration. We encourage you to collaborate with us, rather than compete against us, when utilizing our software. If our tools are useful for your research, consider working with us directly to co-author papers, share data, or contribute to further developments.

3. **Contribute to Mutual Success**  
   Our open-source work is designed to benefit both you and the scientific community. If you find our software valuable:
   - **Cite our work** when using it in research.
   - **Engage us in conversations** about related publications, proposals, or presentations.
   - **Support our efforts** by contributing to our success metrics through co-authorship, funding proposals, or other forms of collaboration.

### **Research Integrity and Collaborative Working**
We adhere to the highest standards of research integrity, as outlined by the **European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity**, and expect the same from all collaborators. 

#### Key Principles:
1. **Reliability**  
   Ensure the quality of research in design, methodology, analysis, and use of resources.
   
2. **Honesty**  
   Conduct, report, and communicate research transparently and without bias.

3. **Respect**  
   Show respect for all contributors, participants, ecosystems, and the broader community.

4. **Accountability**  
   Take responsibility for all aspects of the research process, from idea generation to publication.

### **Collaborative Expectations**
Successful collaboration requires transparency, communication, and mutual respect. To ensure smooth and productive collaborations, we expect the following:

1. **Mutual Goals and Standards**  
   All collaborators must agree from the outset on:
   - Research goals and expectations.
   - Standards for research integrity.
   - Intellectual property rights.
   - Procedures for handling conflicts or cases of misconduct.

2. **Clear Communication**  
   When working together, clear and transparent communication is essential. Please inform us of any plans to use or build upon our software, particularly if it involves publishing or applying for research funding.

3. **Support for Open Science**  
   We encourage you to align with our open science principles by:
   - Sharing your results openly.
   - Citing our contributions appropriately.
   - Acknowledging our work when applicable.


### **Conclusion**
By following these expectations, we can ensure a productive and respectful collaboration that benefits everyone involved. Open science requires time, dedication, and a shared commitment to advancing scientific knowledge. Let’s work together to achieve meaningful impact while supporting the sustainability of scientific research.
