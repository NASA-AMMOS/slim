There are a number of different steps whose goal is to ensure code works together, tests successfully and releases readily. CI is implemented as a development pipeline that automates steps normally undertaken in a release process."]},{"l":"Background","p":["Routine merging of components into a functional software product and publishing compiled binaries is the core of CI. It demands code be committed collaboratively and requires products from different development systems to work together. It tests software builds through a predictable process of known touchpoints that identify specific areas of interoperability and breakage. Compilation results are shared in a centralized system of logging and reporting. These approaches promote many software development best practices, but in particular reduce risk:","Single Source of Truth: All components and configurations must be bundled to prove compiles function, easing deployment of compiled binaries.","Fail Fast/Fix Fast: Know the limitations of compiled integrations and receive immediate notifications about failures.","Visibility/Open Success: The state of the product is reported constantly on CI services.","Testing Availability: Automation allows repeatable deployment to test servers, elevating functional testing on par with release."]},{"i":"pipeline-a-series-of-systems-executing-builds","l":"Pipeline: A series of systems executing builds","p":["A CI pipeline is a series of automated processes, systems and triggers that execute in order to push software from raw code to a compiled product that may be deployed.","The CI pipeline is composed of several systems linked together through a series of automation triggers:","Development System The sum of code commits and code versioning systems, such as Git, comprised of systems that manage raw code. Hosted implementations, such as GitHub, provide limited facilities to validate commits.","Continuous Integration System A collection of services that interact dynamically to perform such tasks as compilation, testing, reporting and/or archiving build artifacts. CI services, such as Jenkins or Travis CI, serve as management node for CI operations.","Continuous Deployment System Tooling and services, such as Ansible or Puppet, that deploy published software into one or more venues for extended testing or delivery. Often, software outputs from the CI pipeline are deployed to development systems for extended user testing."]},{"l":"A CI Pipeline is composed of discrete process steps","p":["The compile-release-publish workflow is broken down to a series of discrete process steps that describe specific operations, ranging from commit processing to publishing compiled binaries. These discrete process steps are reported in logs and reports, helping identify specific points during processing and build failures. Process steps are associated with specific systems in the pipeline based on its role, so the Development System may focus on tracking code merging and commit history, for instance."]},{"l":"Development System","p":["Commit Code management, including developer commits, merging and history, are tracked in this step. A commit triggers notifications to subsequent steps and systems to kick off the CI pipeline.","Validate(optional) Self-contained processing may take place to validate commit content in advance of triggering notifications to subsequent steps and systems. These may include facilities, similar to Github Actions, that can be leveraged to validate files, amongst other tasks."]},{"l":"Continuous Integration System","p":["Compile(core) Core software packages are compiled and the capacity to compile is validated, resulting in unpackaged binaries. Failures at this step indicate a problem in code, code merges or tooling.","Test At the core of CI is testing. The process is inherently checking for successful compilation and execution, and optionally validating software with unit, integration and other tests. Successful Execution: Builds are inherently validated to ensure compilations complete successfully, and other processes germane to the build complete. Errors or failures result in build failure where the compile-release-publish process is halted. Software Testing:(optional, desirable) Test software packages are compiled and the capacity to compile tests is validated, also. The test step will execute the compiled tests against core software packages to run unit and other types of functional tests on every build. Builds will proceed if no tests are implemented, however, test validation is material to the CI philosophy.","Report At the core of CI is reporting, both notifications and functional reporting. Notifications: Developers are notified on successful completion of builds or failures. These notifications support a number of electronic media, such as email, RSS feed and chat messaging in commonly used applications, such as Slack. Other notifications may trigger subsequent automation steps and systems through technologies such as RESTful Web service messaging or simple HTTP requests. Think of notifying a Kubernetes service to start deployment to a cloud computing platform. Functional Reporting:(compile status, test results) Reports are a built-in feature in many CI systems, but extended reports can be generated also to track such items as test results locally or in connected systems. The Jenkins build server, for instance, maintains build logs that tie commit history and compile results to every single execution. Similarly, results from tests can be reported using extended tooling to servers such as Gurock TestRail to retain test runs from every build. Build logs typically span all aspects of the compile-release-publish workflow, from code checkout to publishing compiled binaries.","Package The result of code compilation must be deliverable as manageable objects, and that is the purpose of the packaging phase. One or more compiled binaries may exist, as well as a set of properties or other application-required configurations. These are bundled into one or more collections typically compressed using one of a number of common formats, such as ZIP, JAR or TAR. In practice many build frameworks, such as Apache Maven, package automatically. This step allows the CI system to bundle, protect and lock down files for distribution and reproducibility.","Publish The results of the compile-release-publish process are packaged binaries. These are shared with development and devops communities by publishing the files to one or more artifact repositories, such as JFrog Artifactory. Packaged binaries are versioned, checksummed and do not change after release -- core features of reliable and reproducible CI software delivery."]},{"l":"Continuous Deployment System","p":["Orchestrate(optional) The orchestration process downloads files and prepares target servers to launch. It moves compiled binaries and properties into place and configures required services on destination systems. Depending on complexity of the final product this step is optional.","Release(optional) In CI implementations releasing product typically starts and announces applications on a development server used for extended functionality testing. An extension of this, Continuous Delivery (CD), automates functionality testing and deploys to multiple release runway destinations, including potentially directly to production. Releasing compiled product is optional depending on intended use cases (executable vs. API library) or whether further testing is desired."]},{"l":"Actors and Automation","p":["A more robust view of CI architecture describes the participants, both users and automated systems. The CI process always starts with developers who commit code, and it finishes with reliable, unchanging, versioned and packaged software delivered by an automated system."]},{"i":"note-physical-servers-are-numbered-in-the-above-diagram","l":"NOTE: Physical servers are numbered in the above diagram."},{"l":"Participant Touchpoints","p":["The actors in the CI process are code maintainers and end users. The automation takes place in servers or services between these actors. A more detailed understanding of the process itemizes the roles and responsibilities of each participant. This graph interleaves services with users and processes to explain process flow.","\uD83D\uDC69‍\uD83D\uDCBB [Action: Push] Developers, or code maintainers, (\"Dev 1...n\") start the build process by committing and pushing code to a remote version control server (VCS), such as Git. This may be anything from a minor property change to new code, but in all cases the expectation is that code from one maintainers' workstation should execute identically and reliably on others.","1\uD83D\uDDA5 [Start-- Action: Trigger, Content Validation] The VCS server reports when new code is delivered (commit) and performs content validation on that code. Content validation can range from verifying format of data in the commit to checking for specific content in files. On code acceptance and validation, a network request triggers to notify successive machines to continue processing.","2\uD83D\uDDA5 [Service-- Action: Validate, Publish, Deploy (opt.), Report] The Continuous Integration Server(CI Server) provides a platform to execute various steps in the CI process. It's the core that handles both decision making and mechanics of compilation, testing and packaging. A unified interface provides a centralized location to view progress and success of application builds. The CI Server makes decisions on whether to proceed when code compiles and examines test results to verify test passes. It typically retains detailed logs of processes and test results that are made available through a user interface for on-demand viewing. Notifications are provided through both the user interface and other media, such as email. Additionally, the CI Server provides the platform that executes post-build steps, including publishing packaged artifacts or deploying those artifacts to servers for user consumption. This is all accomplished using built-in tooling or compatible scripting.","3\uD83D\uDDA5 [Endpoint] The Artifact Repository is a dedicated software library for storing various build products (\"artifacts\") that is available on demand to developers, users and implementers. On successful builds the CI server publishes packaged artifacts to the repository to make them available broadly.","4\uD83D\uDDA5 [Endpoint] The Application Server provides an execution environment with the final software package deployed in a runtime environment for extended use testing. Depending on the type of software project -- whether it's an API library, server application or executable -- deployment optionally provides a platform to demonstrate the product. Automated testing can be further leveraged to verify that an application performs as designed. Some CI processes extend the concept of automated deployment through a series of server destinations along a release runway. \"Continuous Deployment (CD)\" extends the CI process to automatically deploy packaged software in a production environment.","5\uD83D\uDDA5 [Service-- Notification and Reporting Services] Notify and Reporting Services assume different forms to provide real-time information on build status. These are typically handled within the CI Server in the case of build failure emails. Build logs are published to the CI Server user interface for on-demand inspection. However, reporting in a CI process may also take the form of automated ticket creation in issue tracking software, such as Atlassian Jira or test case reporting in test management software, such as Gurock TestRail. Notification is highly customizable in the CI server and in most cases leverages built-in server features.","\uD83D\uDC65 [End-- Action: Usage] The target audience is, of course, the User Community(\"User 1...n\"), which is comprised of a number of participants from developers to application users. Primarily, the CI process delivers packaged binaries available for download, usage or integration from the Artifact Repository. These may be executed directly or used as dependencies in other code. A running version of the application may also be provided with an automated deployment to an Application Server. However, generally, users benefit prodigiously from logs, notifications and other information that provide invaluable insight and transparency to otherwise detailed and intricate build systems producing modern software.","Ultimately, the CI process benefits all users with a predictable, controlled and automated mechanism to produce reliable software that is transparent and self-validating.

Providing an visual example of your modifications is highly encouraged. After your pull request has been evaluated, and you've incorporated change requests / feedback from the community, a maintainer for the project will decide and work towards merging your changes into SLIM for everyone to benefit from.","Choose a Use Case- in this step, you'll want first pick a \"branch\" in your markmap rendering, or non-leaf-node item within your use cases markdown file, that has a list of solutions / tools underneath it that offer SLIM community members some decisions to make based on a trade-study you'll create.","Choose a Use Case- in this step, you'll want first pick a \"branch\" in your markmap rendering, or non-leaf-node item within your use cases markdown file, that has a list of solutions / tools underneath it.","Create a Starter Kit- here, you will want to spend some dedicated time to create a starter kit. A starter kit can be anything that helps SLIM community members automate some aspect of the use use case you've picked. For example, for our \"Documentation Hosting\" best practice guide, we offer Markdown templates for various types of documentation categories - thus starter kits don't just need to be code or configuration. Think of starter kits as some form of automation that can be quickly and easily infused into SLIM community member projects, with minor adjustments. Additionally, it's always a good idea to make your starter kit as generic as possible, including using environment variables to allow SLIM community members to customize the starter kit easily. Add your starter kit scripts or configuration to the starter-kits/ folder within your best practices parent folder and see examples in other best practice guides for guidance.","Create Pull Request- in this step, you'll want to create a pull-request for the SLIM community to get feedback on:","Create Reference Architecture Diagrams- in this step, take the use case you've chosen and create an architectural reference diagram for it to illustrate how your solutions / tools address the use case. It's a little bit of an art at this point, but you'll want to keep the level of abstraction high enough that specific solution / tools can be swapped in or out but your diagram will still remain valid. The key idea here is to provide a reference architecture that's largely tool-agnostic, and can be used by SLIM community members easily to understand how a best practice solution data or process flow may look like. The recommended diagramming language here is the Mermaid markdown diagramming tool that has native Markdown integrations. This way, diagrams can be easily understood, version controlled, and edited by multiple people. We recommend you follow this tutorial to get started with this framework, use the flowchart diagram feature, and document your flow chart architecture diagram in /reference-architectures/ref-archi-XYZ.md. We also recommend you edit your mind-map markdown files to link to your reference architecture diagrams using hyperlinks. See Markmap examples for hyperlinking.","Create Use Cases Diagram- here you'll want to diagram the research you've collected on scenario / use cases and tools in a format that SLIM community members can easily understand and comment on. The diagramming approach we're recommending with use cases is to create a mind-map. See the Wikipedia article on mind mapping for more information about the technique. To generate consistent mind map diagrams, we're suggesting you use a tool called MarkMap both because it creates interactive mind-maps and because it support diagrams being version controlled and easily edited by multiple people. What you'll want to do is to edit the /use-cases/markmap.md document in your local directory with use case and tool information you've researched. Add parent nodes for use cases and leaf nodes for tools within the markdown file. The use cases should come first, and be broken down into categories that logically model the tree of use cases you've collected. You can be as limited or as comprehensive as you like with the use cases, the key is to make sure the use cases are readable. A suggestion is to prefix the parent / child node relationships in this file with English-language prepositions (e.g. In, From, To) for the use case information and the keyword \"Using\" for the tool information. For example, a parent-child relationship within your markdown file to help share best practices for documentation hosting could be:","Infuse Starter Kits- this is the final recommended step of the creating a guide. The key point of creating starter kits is to infuse them in SLIM community member projects in a consistent way. Since you've worked so hard to make a starter kit, now is the time to propose the starter kit to as many SLIM community member projects as possible! We recommend two methods of infusion:","Once you've documented your use cases and tools within the respective markmap.md file, you'll just need to add and commit your file to GitHub, where an automated GitHub Action (markmap) will auto-generate an equivalent markmap.html rendering of your markdown file and commit it to the same directory where you've stored the markmap.md file (inside the use-cases directory).","Perform Trade Study- for the \"branch\" use case you picked in step 1, you'll now want to do some research on important metric criteria by which to evaluate possible tools / solutions. Consider things like important feature differences, performance, monetary cost, maturity, etc., when choosing criteria to evaluate the solution / tools for your use case upon. In terms of actually documenting your trade-studies, we recommend using markdown tables, this way the documentation you write can be easily viewed, version controlled, and modified by multiple people. Add your diagrams to the trade-studies/ folder within your best practices parent folder. See the existing examples available in best practice guides for guidance.","Pull Request- in this step, you'll want to create a pull-request for the SLIM community to get feedback on:","Reach out to SLIM community member projects and socialize your new starter kit to gain interest. Leverage our communication channels for this purpose.","Reference Architectures","Research Use Cases- search the internet, read books, articles, and talk to folks to understand which scenarios and use cases may apply to the process improvement need. For example, if the need is something like \"Living documentation best practices for development lifecycle artifacts\" then some use cases could involve things like Automated PyDoc documentation generation from code, User guide generation from static GitHub flavored Markdown. Basically, consult the community and literature to get specific on the pressing use case scenarios for this need, and identify tools that may help support or satisfy this need.","Starter Kits","Taking the initiative and creating pull requests or text-file patches using your starter kits for SLIM community member projects. Many SLIM community member projects are busy and may not have the time to propose your starter kits on their own, so leverage the best practice of open development and propose a starter kit to some aspect of their codebase.","The coverage of use cases in your diagram (e.g. are you missing critical use cases?)","The ease-of-use of your starter kit","The level-of-abstraction of your diagram, and whether its appropriate to generalize the tools you have outlined","The scope of metrics you've chosen to perform your trade study upon","The scope of steps within your architecture diagram","The understandability of your metric values, for the given solution / tools you're evaluating","The usefulness of your starter kit","To help you understand the recommended process diagrammed above, this section explains each component of the diagram:","Trade Studies","Use Cases"]},{"l":"For Adding Improvements to an Existing Best Practice Guide","p":["The Adding a New Best Practice Guide section explains in detail how to add a new best practice guide.
